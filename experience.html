		<h1 style="border:2px solid MediumAquaMarine;"><i>How I build my self -confidence to speak in public</i></h1>
	<p>
		<blockquote>I am a very shy and quiet person. I also always isolate myself from people due to lack of self -confidence. When I was 6 Years old, my kindergarten teacher chose me to enter a storytelling competition. I don’t know anything and just follow whatever my teacher teaches. During the day of the competition, it is still clear in my memory, for the first time, I stood on stage and in front of a crowd. I wore a pigeon costume because the story I brought was titled ‘The Story of the Pigeons and Ants’. I felt so nervous and scared that my eyes watered. The kindergarten teacher and my mother who stood near the stage to watch me at the time, tried to calm and encourage me so I could finish my story. At the time, I got third place in the storytelling competition.  When I was 9 years old, I once again competed in a storytelling competition. The competition back then was very fierce and I just got consolation. From there, however, I developed an interest in public speaking. When I was 10 Years old, my teacher suggested that I participate in a speech contest. I wasn’t sure at the time because I had never seen anyone give a speech so I didn’t know what a speech was. Still, with encouragement from my teacher, I agreed to try to compete in a speech contest. I practiced speech diligently with guidance from my teacher. As a result, I managed to become the champion of the speech contest. I am very happy and thankful for that achievement. After that, I started to be confident and no longer afraid to try new things. I began to understand that to improve the quality of ourselves, we need to strive and find ways to change ourselves for the better.

        <h1 style="border:2px solid PaleTurquoise;"><i>Blood donation experience</i></h1>
        <p>
        	<blockquote>Recently I donated blood for the first time. Before this, I had no opportunity to donate blood. On 13 January 2022, the Health Unit at UiTM Rembau organized a blood donation campaign. So, I took the opportunity to donate blood. When I came, I was required to fill out some forms. On the form, we need to fill in personal information. Then, I was required to go to a table to confirm my blood type. As a result, my blood was type B blood. Later, I met with the doctor for a health declaration and to measure my blood pressure level. The doctor asked me if I had a history of infectious disease or was taking any medications. I answered no. After seeing my blood pressure at a good level, I was allowed to donate blood. I was assisted by a very friendly and kind nurse. The needle that was pricked into my arm was larger than the usual needle we see. After 15 minutes, one bag of my blood of 350 ml was full. After that, the nurse removed the needle on my arm and asked me to rest for a while before being allowed to go home. Alhamdulillah, after donating blood, my body is in good condition. For those who want to donate blood, you need to eat heavy food before donating blood because to supply energy to you and so that you do not feel weak after donating blood. Plus, not everyone is allowed to donate blood, many of my friends are not allowed to donate blood because they weigh less than 45kg. However, for those who are healthy and qualified to donate blood, I advise you to donate to help those in need together.
